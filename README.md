# Creating an End-to-End ML Application w/ <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/madewithml/images/master/images/pytorch.png" width="25rem"> PyTorch

🚀 This project was created using the Made With ML [boilerplate](https://github.com/madewithml/boilerplate) template. Check it out to start creating your own ML applications.

## Overview
- **Why do we need to build end-to-end applications?**
    - By building e2e applications, you ensure that your code is organized, tested, testable / interactive and easy to scale-up / assimilate with larger pipelines.
    - If you're someone in industry and are looking to showcase your work to future employers, it's no longer enough to just have code on Jupyter notebooks. ML is just another tool and you need to show that you can use it in conjunction with all the other software engineering disciplines (frontend, backend, devops, etc.). The perfect way to do this is to create end-to-end applications that utilize all these different facets.
- **What are the components of an end-to-end ML application?**
    1. Basic experimentation in Jupyter notebooks.
        - We aren't going to completely dismiss notebooks because they're still great tool to iterate quickly. Check out the notebook for our task here → [notebook](https://github.com/madewithml/e2e-ml-app-pytorch/blob/master/notebook.ipynb)
    2. Moving our code from notebooks to organized scripts.
        - Once we did some basic development (on downsized datasets), we want to move our code to scripts to reduce technical debt. We'll create functions and classes for different parts of the pipeline (data, model, train, etc.) so we can easily make them robust for different circumstances.
        - We used our own [boilerplate](https://github.com/madewithml/boilerplate) to organize our code before moving any of the code from our notebook.
    3. Proper logging and testing for you code.
        - Log key events (preprocessing, training performance, etc.) using the built-in [logging](https://docs.python.org/2/howto/logging.html) library. Also use logging to see new inputs and outputs during prediction to catch issues, etc.
        - You also need to properly test your code. You will add and update your functions and their tests over time but it's important to at least start testing crucial pieces of your code from the beginning. These typically include sanity checks with preprocessing and modeling functions to catch issues early. There are many options for testing Python code but we'll use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) here.
    4. Experiment tracking.
        - We use [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.com) (WandB), where you can easily track all the metrics of your experiment, config files, performance details, etc. for free. Check out the [Dashboards page](https://www.wandb.com/experiment-tracking) for an overview and tutorials.
        - When you're developing your models, start with simple approaches first and then slowly add complexity. You should clearly document (README, articles and [WandB reports](https://www.wandb.com/articles/workspaces-tables-reports-oh-my)) and save your progression from simple to more complex models so your audience can see the improvements. The ability to write well and document your thinking process is a core skill to have in research and industry.
        - WandB also has free tools for hyperparameter tuning ([Sweeps](https://www.wandb.com/sweeps)) and for data/pipeline/model management ([Artifacts](https://www.wandb.com/artifacts)).
    4. Wrap your model as an API.
        - Now we start to modularize larger operations (single/batch predict, get experiment details, etc.) so others can use our application without having to execute granular code. There are many options for this like [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), etc. but we'll use FastAPI for the ease and [performance](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#performance) boost.
        - We can also use a Dockerfile to create a [Docker](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-docker-can-help-you-become-a-more-effective-data-scientist-7fc048ef91d5) image that runs our API. This is a great way to package our entire application to scale it (horizontally and vertically) depending on requirements and usage.
    5. Create an interactive frontend for your application.
        - The best way to showcase your work is to let others easily play with it. We'll be using [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) to very quickly create an interactive medium for our application and use [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) to serve it (1000 hours of usage per month).
        - This is also a great skill to have because in industry you'll need to create this to show key stakeholders and great to have in documentation as well.

## Next steps
End-to-end topics that will be covered in subsequent lessons.
- Utilizing wrappers like [PyTorch Lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning) to structure the modeling even more while getting some very useful utility.
- Data / model version control ([Artifacts](https://www.wandb.com/artifacts), [DVC](https://dvc.org/), [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/), etc.)
- Experiment tracking options ([MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/), [KubeFlow](https://www.kubeflow.org/), [WandB](https://www.wandb.com/), [Comet](https://www.comet.ml/site/), [Neptune](https://neptune.ai/), etc)
- Hyperparameter tuning options ([Optuna](https://optuna.org/), [Hyperopt](https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt), [Sweeps](https://www.wandb.com/sweeps))
- Multi-process data loading
- Dealing with imbalanced datasets
- Distributed training for much larger models
- GitHub actions for automatic testing during commits
- Inference fail safe techniques (though we do have some basic tests here such as displaying UNK tokens and knowing which classes we need great certainty in)
